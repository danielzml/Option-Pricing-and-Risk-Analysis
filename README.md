This project explores Bear Risk Reversals. Assuming that the underlying stock dynamics follows a Black-Scholes model under the real world measure, we derive the option prices and simulate 50,000 scenarios in Python to compute Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) with 95% confidence level and 1-year risk horizon, with histograms of portfolio loss distributions for different levels of stock volatility.
